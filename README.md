# portfolio-from-template

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to recreate a working website inspired by [this](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/piroll-design-template-agencypersonal-portfolio/) template.

I used this project as an opportunity to practice flex-box layout and learn how to produce vector graphics.

the finished website can be found [here](http://sour-family.surge.sh/)
